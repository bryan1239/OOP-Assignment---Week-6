# OOP-Assignment---Week-6
# 🏗️ Python OOP Project: Superhero Class & Polymorphism Activity

## 📚 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

This section demonstrates how to create a custom class in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

### ✨ Superhero Class Features:
- Base class: `Superhero` with attributes like `name`, `power`, and `origin`.
- Subclasses:
  - `TechHero`: Adds `gadget` and overrides the `attack()` method.
  - `MagicHero`: Adds `spell` and also overrides `attack()`.

### 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Encapsulation** – Grouping related attributes and methods in a class.
- **Inheritance** – Subclasses inherit from a base class.
- **Polymorphism** – Each subclass defines its own version of `attack()`.

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

This activity shows how different classes can share a method name but implement it differently.

### 🚗 Vehicle Classes:
- `Car` → `move()` prints: *"Driving 🚗"*
- `Plane` → `move()` prints: *"Flying ✈️"*
- `Boat` → `move()` prints: *"Sailing 🚤"*

All inherit from a base class `Vehicle`, demonstrating **polymorphism** through method overriding.
